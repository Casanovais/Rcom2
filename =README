This directory contains programs (or pointers thereto) that are part
of the GNU system, as well as GNU Manuals, and general information on
project GNU.

Programs that are directly in this directory are actually GNU
programs, developed under the auspices of GNU.

We do, however, distribute some non-GNU programs through our FTP
server, or provide pointers to where they are.  We put these
programs/pointers in the subdirectory non-gnu since they are not
developed by the GNU project. They are, of course, part of the GNU
system. See:
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html#TheGNUsystem

Older versions of some GNU programs are archived in the directory
old-gnu on ftp.gnu.org (probably not mirrored on our mirror sites).

Software programs are placed here in one of the following formats:

program.README	A README file that is just a pointer describing where
		to get that program and briefly describing the function of
		the program.

program/	A directory containing full distributions of that program.

There are other files here as well:

Manuals/	A directory containing our GNU manuals in various formats.

GNUinfo/	A directory containing information on the GNU project,
		including our task list and coding standards.

non-gnu/	We distribute some non-GNU programs through our FTP server, or
		provide pointers to where they are.  We put these
		programs/pointers in this directory since they are not
		developed by the GNU project. They are, of course, part of
		the GNU system.
